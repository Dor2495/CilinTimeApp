# CilinTimeApp

Hey Guys, 
this project is an old idea of making a full system for buisnesses that help them manage their schedule.

I started to learn coding on 2021 at the Technion Instetude, there I learned all basics of coding and computring.
For my final project for the Technion, my partner and I are building that exact system - a PC application for the admin, a Server, DataBase and an Android App for the customers!

This app is my own project - making an app that runs on iOS with the server and DataBase that will be used in the PC and the Android app. 
I know that it will be an amazing adveture to learn new technics and improve my skills with Swift and SwiftUI.

Please share your ideas and comment with me ! I would love to learn from each of you.

Stay tuned.
